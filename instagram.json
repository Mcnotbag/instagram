Get together with a group of family members, friends or classmates to enjoy each other\u2019s company through an activity that lends itself to visuals, like a picnic in your favorite park.\nShow support. Do a good deed while you\u2019re with your people. Shelter someone under an umbrella or give someone a gift. It can even be as simple as sharing a hug with someone who needs it.\nGet creative. Build your image around a giant heart, incorporate flowers in your composition or include symbolic motifs like the image of a butterfly or rainbow to give your video or photo an optimistic tone.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPkindness hashtag only to photos and videos shared over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

Here are some tips for the project:\nGet twinning. Whether you dress up friends identically or capture a mirror image of the moon on a lake, get creative with how the concept of \u201ctwinning\u201d can show up in photos and videos.\nConsider classic duos. Find objects that come together for your composition. Think of a knife and fork, cereal and milk, or even sticks and stones.\nMatch unlikely pairs. Go beyond identical images or classic duos by playing with the way people and objects relate. Take a photo of a friend in a green sweater enjoying a matcha ice-cream cone, or have a sibling stretch out in the same shape of your favorite backyard tree.\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPmatching hashtag only to photos and videos shared over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video shared over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week."},

Consider the range of motions you can document that reflect different feelings or emotions, like the quiet and soothing way wind gently blows your friend\u2019s hair, or the high-energy action of your sibling splashing in a pool. \nPlan the capture. The way you document movement can bring another dimension to your #WHPmotion submission. For example, you could blur the action by tracking the motion of a bright car as it drives through a busy junction to create an abstract environment, or you could capture a cat midair as it jumps down from the furniture for a freeze-frame effect.\n\nPlay with creative tools. Slow motion or time-lapse can exaggerate the mood and movement in your submission, or multiple exposures can track multiple positions of someone moving through your frame. \nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPmotion hashtag only to photos and videos shared over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

Here are some tips to get you started:\nCapture a familiar subject or scene from an unexpected angle. Get up close and let a face cover the entire frame, or make a puppy look large by shooting from ground-level as she stares down. Find a high vantage point to show the wider context of a festival scene or bustling market.\nUse geometry to your advantage. Look for graphic lines \u2014 in bridges or telephone wires \u2014 that converge to a vanishing point in your composition. Find a new way to capture patterns in everyday places, like the wheels of bicycles lined up in a rack, or symmetrical bricks in an unruly garden.\nPlay an eye trick. Defy gravity with simple editing, like rotating the frame. Recruit a friend to make a well-timed leap, that, when rotated, looks like they\u2019re flying through air. Or turn a dandelion into a human-size parasol by playing with scale and distance.\n\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPperspective hashtag only to photos and videos shared over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

Immediately, she noticed that some of the flowers stayed bright and beautiful after they came out of the oven, and others lost their color. \u201cIt\u2019s like a never-ending science experiment,\u201d says Lori, who, after many batches of cookies, has figured out many of her favorite flowers to bake with, like pomegranate petal, calendula, geraniums and pansies.\nWhether she\u2019s decorating cookies, custom wedding cakes or savory brunch recipes, Lori loves every step of her work. \u201cIt\u2019s so gratifying to feed people.
